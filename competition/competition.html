                                    <p>In May 2021, hackers attacked Colonial Pipeline, the largest pipeline 
                                        system for refined oil products in the U.S. carrying 
                                        3 million barrels of fuel per day between Texas and New York.
                                        The ransomware cyberattack caused five-days pipeline shutdown, 
                                        which resulted in a temporary fuel shortage along the East Coast (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline">Wiki</a>).
                                        The consequences of cyberattacks can be devastating, such as electrical blackouts, failure of military equipment, 
                                        and even breaches of national security secrets. Considering other similar incidents of Colonial Pipeline such as SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange, 
                                        President Biden signed an Executive Order to improve the nationâ€™s cybersecurity and protect federal government networks. <br>
                                        
                                        To bolster cyber security, even with the higher and higher proposed budget of the U.S. government for cyber security, the Biden administration seeks 
                                        another boost on the budget of fiscal year (FY) 2023 on 
                                     cyber related task -- an increase of $800 million, nearly 8%, 
                                     over the FY 2022, and $1.4 billion more than the plan for the FY 
                                     before that (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2022/03/28/pentagon-seeks-112-billion-for-cyber-in-fy23-budget-request/">Source: C4ISRNET</a>). 
                                     Meanwhile, Department of Defense (DoD), whose spending accounts for 14.9% of the total spending of the U.S. 
                                     Federal Government in FY 2022, awarded contractor, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rtx.com/">Raytheon Technologies</a> (former as Raytheon Company), 
                                     for researching and developing weapons and military and commercial electronics. Programs of contractors like Raytheon Technologies and their sub-contractors could easily be the targets

                                        were analyzed in this project. The data can be directly downloaded from

                                        is mainly for Research and Development, the sub-award types cover from developing or improving technologies for various parts for millitary use, such as 
                                        accelerometers, cables, lithium batteries, to non-product service, such as Tech/Eng services. The total awarded amount to programs of  
                                        sub-contractors is $654.3 million, or 256.5% of the Raytheon Company's total obligated amount, which is $255.1 million. <br>

                                <p>The subawardees (sub-contractors) of the Raytheon Company cover 25 states through out the U.S. The top 3 states with most total award amount are Maryland, Arizona, and California (Figure 1). The top 3 states with most awards are Arizona (73), California (68), and Maryland (26). The top 3 states with highest average 
                                     amount per award are Maryland ($21 M), West Virginia ($2.2 M), and Connecticut ($1.4 M). Overall, subawardees from the state of Maryland have been awarded $553.3 M, or 84.6% of the total award amount from the Raytheon Company.

                                 <p>Each award (project) is awared to certain business type subawardees and has award description. Those information describes 
                                     the characteristics of the award and subawardee. The business type describes what is the award for. For example, 
                                     whether the subawardee a For-Profit Organization or not, or whether the award is for a manufacturer of goods instead of 
                                     providing service. In the Raytheon Company dataset, only three awards were awarded to Non-profit organization with total amount of $213 k. All other awards were 
                                     awarded to For-Profit Organizations. Most awards went to companies with business of "Manufacturer of Goods". There are 29 unique subawardee business types through out 348 award records. </p>
                                    <p>Another interesting 
                                     feature of the data is the award description, which implies the project nature. It describes what product or service they are manufacturing or providing. For example, 
                                     the award could be given to explosive cut device development, missile antenna, or only for other Non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost without mentioning the 
                                     particular product. There are 73 unique award descriptions through out 348 award records.

                                    to hackers. Thus, identifying whether a subawardee company

                                    <p>Award descriptions, 78 unique types in total, were divided into three categories using hierarchical clustering method. Type 1 
                                        contains 175 award records, and type 2 contains 160 award records, while 13 award records fell into "Other" category. 
                                        Type 1 mainly contains awards of NRE cost (Figure 2), while Type 2 contains NRE cost and other manufacturing product such 
                                        as detonator and fuselage. In other words, Type 2 award is mainly for product development, while Type 1 award 
                                        is for NRE cost.

                                    <p>K-prototype requires a hyperparameter of the number of the groups. The Elbow method was used to

                                <p>After dividing all the award records (awarded projects) into three groups, the profiles of each group 
                                    can be obtained (Figure 4). Group 1 contains 145 awards with most of them not from subawardees who manufacture products and are not 
                                    owned by a veteran. Most of the awards in Group 1 are with Type 1 award description (NRE cost). The median award amount is $101361, which is relatively small among all the 
                                    records. Group 2 contains 193 awards with most of them from subawardees who manufacture products but are not owned by a veteran. The dominant award description 
                                    is Type 2 (product development). The project period of Group 2 is shortest, which means the award has not been awarded too long. Group 3 
                                    contains 10 awards with median award amount of $48 M. The awards in Group 3 were from subawardees who manufacture products and are owned by 
                                    a veteran.
