0,real estate,Bitcoin and similar blockchain based cryptos exhibit the same radical divergence from traditional scarcity economics that we first saw when MP s and Napster cratered physical album sales at the turn of the century Unlike gold which derives its value from both its myriad uses in fashion and industry as well as the difficulty involved in extracting it from the Earth acquiring new Bitcoin is as simple as digitally mining more of the stuff In his latest book The Future of Money Senior Professor of Trade Policy at Cornell University Eswar S Prasad deftly examines how we collectively assign value to these digital constructs and what that means for the economics of tomorrow At a conference held in Scotland in March then Bank of England governor Mark Carney observed that the prices of many cryptocurrencies have exhibited the classic hallmarks of bubbles including new paradigm justifications broadening retail enthusiasm and extrapolative price expectations reliant in part on finding the greater fool The last phrase in his statement was an allusion to the period of seemingly ever rising real estate prices during the US housing boom of the early to mid s High and rising real estate valuations seemed to be based on the notion that all it took to make money from a house purchased at inflated prices was to find just one buyer an even greater fool than oneself willing to pay an even higher price Carney s speech came on the heels of another by Agust n Carstens head of the Bank for International Settlements he described Bitcoin as a combination of a bubble a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster Skeptics including central bankers and academics correctly note Bitcoin s extremely volatile prices and the periodic price collapses it has experienced Indeed from an economist s perspective there is no logical reason Bitcoin should be priced beyond its value in providing an anonymous payment mechanism let alone the sort of value it commands Yet even as it has shed all pretense of being an effective medium of exchange Bitcoin has maintained the faith of its adherents It seems not just to persevere but has become an increasingly prized store of value or perhaps more accurately an attractive speculative asset at least as this book is being written this could all change in a moment What accounts for this To address this question we must first consider what gives a financial asset tangible or not economic value For one thing an asset represents a claim on future goods and services Owning a share of stock or debt issued by a firm is a claim on the firm s future earnings which in turn is based on its ability to create real products or services that have monetary value The same is true for real estate which yields real services to homeowners or renters that can be monetized Owning a government bond is in principle a claim on future government revenues which could come from taxes or other sources Gold is dif ferent It has an intrinsic value based on its industrial use and it is also used in jewelry and tooth fillings But its market value seems far greater than its intrinsic value based on these uses It appears that gold derives its value mainly from scarcity rather than its usefulness or any claim it offers of a future flow of goods and services Scarcity by itself is clearly not enough there has to be enough demand for an asset as well Such demand could hang on a thread as slender as a collective belief in the market value of the asset if you think there are other people who value gold as much as you do and enough people feel the same way gold has value So is Bitcoin just a digital version of gold with its value determined mainly by its scarcity The limit of twenty one million bitcoins is hardcoded into the algorithm making it scarce by construction But there still needs to be demand for it as even Bitcoin cannot escape the basic laws of market economics especially the determination of prices based on supply and demand Such demand could of course be purely speculative in nature as seems to be the case now that Bitcoin is not working well as a medium of exchange It does take copious amounts of computing power and electricity to mine Bitcoin and unfortunately computers and electricity have to be paid for in real money which is still represented by fiat currencies It has been argued that Bitcoin s baseline price is determined by this mining cost One research company estimated the electricity cost of mining one bitcoin in the United States to be about in Another company estimated the overall break even cost of mining a bitcoin in at suggesting that this constituted a floor for its price But this is hardly reasonable logic Just because something takes a lot of resources to produce is not enough to create demand for it and therefore to justify its price Bitcoin devotees needless to say have an answer for this given the technologically inclined nature of this community it had to be a quantitative model The model if it can be called that uses the ratio of the existing stock relative to the flow of new units as an anchor for the price Consider gold The total stock of gold that exists in the world above ground is estimated at about metric tons Roughly tons of gold are mined each year which amounts to about percent of the existing stock Thus the stock to flow ratio is about sixty It would take that many years for annual gold production assuming it continues at the average rate to reproduce the existing stock For silver this ratio is about twenty two The logic of this pricing model appears to be that even doubling the annual rate of gold or silver production would leave their stock to flow ratios high in which case they would remain viable stores of value with high prices The physical constraints on supply ramping up mining operations would take a long time mean there is little risk of a surge in supply knocking down prices of the existing stock By contrast for other less precious commodities including metals such as copper and platinum the existing stock is equal to or lower than annual production Thus as soon as the price begins rising production can be ramped up preventing large price hikes With these commodities prices are more closely tied to values based on industrial and other practical uses In the stock of Bitcoin that had been mined was estimated to be around twenty five times larger than that of the new coins produced in that year This is high but still less than half of the stock to flow ratio for gold Around Bitcoin s stock to flow ratio is expected to overtake that for gold Thus if one accepts this logic the price of Bitcoin must eventually rise This valuation is built entirely on a fragile foundation of faith As one influential Bitcoin blogger puts it Bitcoin is the first scarce digital object the world has ever seen Surely this digital scarcity has value This blogger makes profuse allusions which are echoed on most websites and chat boards frequented by Bitcoin adherents to how Bitcoin and gold are analogous It is the consistently low rate of supply of gold that is the fundamental reason it has maintained its monetary role throughout human history The high stock to flow ratio of gold makes it the commodity with the lowest price elasticity of supply Fiat money and other cryptocurrencies that have no supply cap no Proof of Work consensus protocol and no need of large amounts of computing power to keep operating are seen as less likely to retain value because their supplies are not constrained and can be influenced by the government or small groups of individuals or stakeholders Clearly logic and reason are not important underpinnings of Bitcoin valuations And it is hard to argue as I have learned with a twenty fiveyear old who bought his first bitcoin at then kept buying and now views every dip in Bitcoin prices as a buying opportunity to add to his stash But as an economist one does worry for that young man whom I sat next to at a conference in January and with whom I ended up having a long and heated discussion and others who have bet their life savings on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Then again with the price of Bitcoin where it is in April perhaps my time would have been better spent in the past few years acquiring some bitcoin rather than laboring on this book 
1,real estate,The buildout of G networks continues apace with wide scale deployments across much of the developed world Yet one of the largest challenges with closing the gaps in coverage maps are constraints on G transmissions Because of the spectrum that G technology uses compared to G telecom operators need to install many times more towers to deliver the advertised bandwidth with the same quality signal that users expect Installing cell towers is a daunting proposition though An operator has to find exactly the right location in terms of line of sight to users then make sure the location has power and internet access and then negotiate a contract with the property owner to keep the tower there for a decade or more Now repeat tens of thousands of times and maybe even more Sitenna which will debut next week as part of Y Combinator s Summer Demo Day wants to radically speed up the process of selecting tower sites and securing contracts creating a marketplace for landlords tower operators and telcos alike Tower siting and access to poles have in some cases emerged as national infrastructure priorities In the United States the challenges around installing new towers and new towers quickly became a top priority of the FCC during the Trump administration which launched a G FAST Plan to try to ease regulations around tower installation Sitenna s founders Daniel Campion and Brian Sexton saw an opportunity with such programs to help with the movement Over the past year they have built out what is essentially a marketplace that on one hand helps property owners figure out if they have an asset that s worth investigating for telecom usage and on the other helps tower operators select and digitally sign deals for installation The company launched in the United Kingdom in June and it kind of resonated Campion said noting that real estate assets and roughly of the towers in the U K are now on the platform The company has kicked off two pilots with Vodafone and its tower provider Cornerstone He said the company intends to enter the U S market in the first quarter of next year While the company is starting with a marketplace like many startups today it is also augmenting that marketplace with B B SaaS tools In its case that means tools for telcos to manage the process of onboarding a new tower location and then managing the asset Once they find the site they ping pong emails back and forth Campion said So we have built some tools to help them on their workflows While there is definitely a large wave of tower installations underway now with the transition to G wireless that wave doesn t mean that tower installation will suddenly dry up in a few years Campion notes that there is a continual refresh of on the carrier side due to everything from changing usage patterns and building redevelopment to just standard hardware replacement And of course there is always G which while completely amorphous today is a real thing that I get invites to conferences for There s always going to be a next generation of wireless and Sitenna wants to become the center for managing that infrastructure 
2,real estate,Supply chain and fleet management solutions company Ryder is partnering with yet another autonomous trucking company On Thursday Ryder announced its plans to help Embark launch a nationwide network of up to transfer points that will be owned and operated by the autonomous trucking developer This is Ryder s third public partnership with autonomous trucking companies It recently announced plans that are currently underway to help Waymo Via scale its autonomous trucking business by helping with standardized fleet maintenance and management Ryder is also working with TuSimple to leverage its own facilities as terminals for the startup We re on the cutting edge and really beginning to understand that AV could have a pretty significant role in the future of transportation logistics so we want to get in as early as possible and start working with these companies that seem to be dominating the market with their technologies Karen Jones Ryder s EVP for new product innovation told TechCrunch While Ryder has been in talks with other AV companies like Kodiak Aurora and Plus Jones said no other deals are as far along in the pipeline Jones says Ryder is hoping to learn and grow through the different use cases its existing partnerships provide as well as come up with a replicable transfer hub model that will help the company go to market faster I think as we move this technology forward there s still a lot of unknowns about how to maintain how to service and how to operate said Jones Ryder is a natural fit to partner with because we have huge facilities for maintenance and then we also have our supply chain and logistics business We are a real operator that knows how these facilities and the complexities of getting vehicles in and out for delivery to larger facilities work As part of its partnership with Embark Ryder will provide yard operations maintenance and fleet management It will also play an advisory role on Embark s network of strategically located transfer points where freight is moved from driverless long haul trucks to driver controlled trucks for first and last mile delivery Ryder is helping Embark to understand what s required at the facilities and cooperating with Embark s third party partners who will either be constructing or locating sites for these facilities says Jones At the start the companies will select sites in key freight markets in California Arizona Texas Georgia Tennessee and Florida through which Embark will be able to begin operations early next year in preparation for a larger commercial launch in Autonomous companies often choose Sun Belt regions to begin operations because it s rare to have to account for inclement weather patterns like snow and sleet making the environment optimal for testing But over the next five years Embark and Ryder aim to work with a network of real estate operators to open Embark transfer points across the country Currently Embark which recently announced plans to go public via a SPAC deal moves freight for companies like HP and Budweiser maker AB inBev as well as Knight Swift Transportation Werner Enterprises and other top U S truckload carriers according to CEO Alex Rodrigues Rodrigues says Embark s current freight partnerships are either pilots or smaller scale versions of what the company plans to launch in the future The company has a fleet of trucks today that operate on highways with a human safety operator in the front seat just in case but usually the driver does not have to take over even if the AV encounters a new scenario Operating on highways means building out a network of off highway transfer hubs which is actually pretty essential even though it will require a lot of capital and time to scale TuSimple by comparison is using existing Ryder locations and retrofitting them to serve as TuSimple terminals rather than building out new terminals like what Embark is doing Waymo Via is also building its own hubs and Ryder s fleet maintenance inspections and roadside assistance will help the autonomous trucking arm of Waymo scale those sites as well as maximize vehicle uptime and reliability As Ryder lends its varied capabilities to all of these different use cases it is able to consider its own potential in the AV space and not just in the logistics of it all Jones said the company is open to operating an autonomous fleet one day if it makes sense to do so on behalf of a customer and is also very entrenched in its first and last mile delivery services There s a number of spaces for Ryder to play as the whole AV initiative evolves but our first foray into this is really servicing and beginning to understand the technology as well as the requirements for operating hubs said Jones

5,real estate,London CNN Business There are a number of reasons for global investors to be keeping close watch on China from signs its economy is slowing to Beijing s disruptive crackdown on private business But the list doesn t end there What s happening Evergrande one of China s largest property developers is in dire straits It warned this week that it could default on its substantial debts listing billion in total liabilities if it can t raise money quickly Should that happen the effects would be felt across the country s banking system The group has also suspended work on some projects as it tries to conserve cash a move that s poised to hit China s property sector Investors are clearly worried Evergrande s shares in Hong Kong are off this year That s significantly worse than the plunge suffered by Alibaba BABA which has been at the center of the Chinese government s efforts to rein in big tech firms Hong Kong s Hang Seng index is off year to date Step back Debt in China s property sector has been a lingering risk to the country s financial system for some time And Evergrande is one of China s most heavily indebted developers It has billion in borrowing due within one year Should Evergrande actually default it would be another destabilizing jolt at an already tenuous moment for markets and the economy Though not guaranteed Beijing would likely intervene to soften the blow Julian Evans Pritchard senior China economist at Capital Economics said in a note to clients in July China s leadership is presumably reluctant to offer a bailout to Evergrande given the desire to punish reckless behavior by private entrepreneurs and discourage speculative property investment he wrote But given the firm s sheer size and systemic role officials would step in to try to ensure an orderly restructuring in the event of a default That said A default would likely lead to tighter financing conditions for the entire real estate sector hurting their businesses Even if other developers avoid a similar fate construction activity is likely to suffer as they are forced to pare back new projects Evans Pritchard said Why it matters China s economy is stuttering due to its aggressive approach to constraining the Delta variant and supply chain woes The Caixin index tracking the country s manufacturing sector released Wednesday fell to in August indicating the first contraction since April Meanwhile Chinese markets have plunged this year as authorities target tech education and other private enterprises wiping trillion off the market value of the country s biggest companies A major default is the last thing China needs right now OPEC and partners meet as oil trades near multi year highs Brent crude futures the global benchmark for oil prices are trading near their highest level in more than two years That gives the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies some cover as representatives meet by videoconference on Wednesday The latest OPEC is expected to affirm its plan announced in July to gradually boost oil production It looks very much as if the timetable for monthly production hikes of barrels per day that was agreed in mid July will be confirmed Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients It helps that the group s market experts are reportedly predicting a supply deficit of barrels per day for the rest of the year thanks to resurgent demand as the economy recovers A caveat The committee foresees an excess of million barrels per day next year if OPEC continues raising output as planned That could weigh on prices in the medium term But for now it s a problem for another day The main focus today will be on the production volume in the coming month Commerzbank said AOC wants Jerome Powell out of a job Wall Street has been rewarding Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell s careful speech at the Jackson Hole symposium last week when he indicated that the Fed will soon begin winding down its emergency economic stimulus program See here The CNN Business Fear Greed Index briefly hit greed territory late Monday before sliding back into neutral mode Tuesday But that doesn t mean everyone is a fan Progressive Democrats including New York Rep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez are calling on President Joe Biden to give the Fed a sweeping makeover by replacing Powell as chairman my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports We urge President Biden to reimagine a Federal Reserve focused on eliminating climate risk and advancing racial and economic justice the lawmakers said in a statement Tuesday The backdrop Powell a Republican and former investment banker was nominated in to lead the powerful Federal Reserve by former President Donald Trump who later soured on his selection Powell s term as chair expires in February and the White House has not said whether he will be reappointed Under Powell the Fed wasted little time responding forcefully to the economic fallout from the pandemic in March Economists have credited the Fed s historic actions with helping to prevent a full blown depression and financial crisis in the United States At a delicate time for the economic recovery Biden may opt to prioritize continuity But the campaign from AOC and colleagues Rashida Tlaib of Michigan Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts Mondaire Jones of New York and Chuy Garcia of Illinois could broaden the conversation about the Fed s role in the economy and in society

7,real estate,Covered from head to toe in a white hazmat suit a small child carrying a backpack half the size of his body toddles down a hospital corridor and arrives at a CT scan room all by himself A year old boy has been infected with Covid unfortunately a caption in the video reads No accompanying parents Going to quarantine alone The scene captured by a nurse at a quarantine hospital in the city of Putian the epicenter of China s latest Delta variant outbreak gripped millions of people when it went viral on Chinese social media this week It makes my heart ache said one of the top comments on Weibo China s Twitter like platform My eyes are getting teary said another The video serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of China s prized zero Covid policy which has helped the country quell multiple resurgences of the virus The elimination playbook consists of placing entire neighborhoods under lockdown testing millions of residents in a matter of days and swiftly isolating infected people and their close contacts in designated facilities This time the strict measures were applied to schoolchildren among whom the outbreak was first detected and spread quickly In Putian of its recently reported cases are under the age of according to the government To prevent further transmission infected children as young as kindergarten age are separated from their parents and put in hospital isolation In a news conference Thursday the Putian government said China s epidemic control rules bar Covid patients from any company during isolation and treatment But if a child and their parent are both infected the hospital would try to arrange them to stay in the same ward an official said Initially some children who came into contact with the infected but tested negative were also quarantined away from their parents That policy was later relaxed with children under allowed to stay with their parents or other family members in quarantine but isolation for infected children remains Zhu Xiaqing the nurse who took the video at the quarantine hospital told the local Fujian Health Daily newspaper her eyes were wet with tears when she saw an ambulance full of children arriving all sealed up in hazmat suits They had arrived late because a child didn t want to leave home and was crying for two hours before being coaxed into the ambulance she said Upon arrival the children had CT scans by themselves Some were so young they couldn t climb onto the scanning table and had to be picked up by a doctor Zhu said Seeing little children all alone by themselves without parents by their sides in a hospital they are unfamiliar and scared of at that moment my heart really ached she added On Weibo some users questioned why children this young couldn t be accompanied by their parents Others pointed out their parents were likely put in centralized quarantine in other facilities as close contacts of the infected It s basically a strategy of rather killing a thousand by mistake than letting one go said Jin Dongyan a virologist at the University of Hong Kong Children shouldn t have needed to undergo such extreme quarantine measures This is the social cost of the zero tolerance approach Government workers stop a biker at the entrance to a residential block under lockdown in Xiamen in southeast China s Fujian province on September Government workers stop a biker at the entrance to a residential block under lockdown in Xiamen in southeast China s Fujian province on September The strict and often hectic implementation of containment measures has sparked discontent before In June hundreds of residents in Foshan Guangdong province protested against weeks of prolonged lockdowns on their neighborhoods Footage of the rally was swiftly scrubbed from the internet while on social media those who criticized or questioned the zero Covid policy were attacked and muffled by online nationalists The zero Covid strategy still enjoys broad support among the wider Chinese public many of whom have grown accustomed to the benefits associated with Covid free living and remain fearful of the virus partly due to unrelenting state media coverage on the devastation the pandemic has caused abroad The success of the stringent approach is partly built on public fear This is not ideal Jin said The correct way is to tell the public the truth about the need to coexist with the virus which is the only sustainable way going forward Across the world a growing list of countries have opened up after mass vaccinations Others such as Singapore and Australia are also shifting away from the zero Covid strategy to a new approach of learning to live with the virus But the Chinese government has remained reluctant to lift border restrictions despite huge achievements in its vaccination drive On Thursday China said it had fully inoculated billion people with domestically made vaccines accounting for of its population of billion The vaccination rate is higher than that of many countries which have opened their borders including the United Kingdom and the United States Jin the expert at the University of Hong Kong said authorities are worried about the efficacy of the vaccines Chinese officials have revealed that some of the early cases in a previous Delta outbreak were fully vaccinated They re concerned that the social immunity is not strong enough They don t have enough confidence in the vaccines he said China is now offering booster shots to fully vaccinated people working at borders customs quarantine facilities Covid hospitals and the aviation industry according to the National Health Commission but it remains to be seen how long the effect of that extra shot will last For the time being the Chinese government is likely to stick to its zero tolerance approach as it attempts to boost public immunity but it will eventually need to learn to live with Covid Jin said It might go on for another year or two But China can t shut its doors forever he said At the quarantine hospital in Putian medical workers have come up with various ways to comfort the infected children They decorated the isolation wards and corridors with cartoon paintings and provided the kids with children s books toys and stationary Nurses also looked after their daily needs and played games with them according to state media But some worry that s not enough During the day it might be okay but at night the kids will still be scared said a comment on Weibo The three Chinese astronauts living in space for days have returned to Earth marking an end to China s longest ever crewed mission The astronauts Nie Haisheng Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo were sent in June to the core module of China s planned space station called Tiangong or Heavenly Palace which is still under construction in a low Earth orbit The crew boarded the Shenzhou spacecraft on Thursday and touched down at the Gobi desert in Inner Mongolia on Friday afternoon state news agency Xinhua reported During their three months at the space station the astronauts conducted two spacewalks to test their equipment new generation spacesuits and life maintenance systems Their mission is a major step in China s plan to complete the space station by December when it s expected to be fully crewed and operational Before then China plans to send three more manned spacecraft and two laboratory modules to the space station It s an ambitious target for China s rapidly expanding space program which has received billions of dollars in government investment and achieved a litany of other milestones in recent years including landing a lunar probe in a previously unexplored area of the moon last December and landing a rover on Mars in May Their ambitions don t end there Earlier this year the Chinese government signed an agreement with Russia to work together to build a moon base China is also planning to launch crewed missions to Mars and deploy a massive space based commercial scale solar power plant by By Jessie Yeung China faces a potential Lehman moment Wall Street is unfazed The implosion of Lehman Brothers years ago this week showed how the collapse of a single entity can send shockwaves around the world Echoes from that event are resounding today as a massive property developer on the other side of the world teeters

Thursday Like Lehman in its heyday Evergrande is massive suggesting a default would be felt widely The company has employees raked in more than billion in sales last year and has more than developments according to Reuters Wall Street is keeping close tabs on the Evergrande situation which highlights the extraordinary amount of borrowing Chinese companies and families have taken on over the years Yet there are no signs that investors think an Evergrande default will infect US markets or the domestic economy For now investors seem confident authorities in Beijing would use their vast control over the Chinese economy to limit the damage And there is no evidence at least so far of contagion in US markets I don t think the Evergrande meltdown and the financial problems of Chinese property companies more broadly will reverberate back on the US economy or markets Mark Zandi chief economist at Moody s Analytics told CNN We think that the China s Lehman moment narrative is wide of the mark Simon MacAdam senior global economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note on Thursday David Kotok co founder and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors agrees dismissing Evergrande as a Chinese domestic credit problem It does not look as if it has any contagion effects on American companies or American financial markets Kotok said We see no credit spread widening Credit spreads the difference between corporate bonds and ultra safe Treasury rates remain very narrow That s a sign that investors aren t worried especially given the Federal Reserve s unprecedented support for the economy and markets Of course that can change in a heartbeat I would change my view at once if I saw any contagion or spillover into the world s biggest economies Kotok said The US Treasury Department declined to comment on the Evergrande situation

9,real estate,Squatting has a long history in Spain often fuelled by high rates of homelessness But there is now a darker phenomenon too squatters who demand a ransom before they will leave a property And this has led to the rise of private eviction companies some of which use threats to achieve their goal Michael Regan was in locked down London when his phone pinged Have you got guests staying the message asked him It was a reference to his holiday home in the Catalan seaside town of Sitges and came from a neighbour Of course I hadn t got anyone staying so that s when the alarm bells went says Michael A Spanish friend of Michael s reported the trespassers to the police who said they would take the case to a judge In Spain this is normal procedure Spanish law allows the police to remove okupas as squatters are known if the owner proves it s their first second or even third or fourth residence but it depends how the rules are interpreted On Michael s terrace a group of young men were drying their washing and playing board games Michael learned This was comforting news he says It wasn t a family that really needed somewhere to live they were professional extortionists So in a way I felt relieved because I knew we could negotiate he remembers So what were Michael s options He could wait for the courts to make a decision that could take up to two years Or he could go private People advised me to hire a company that specialises in negotiating with squatters to get them out Enter FueraOkupas literally translated as Get out squatters The company started work three years ago and now gets calls a day says director Jorge Fe about tenants who aren t paying their rent and about squatters His employees are boxers and martial arts experts he says men who are not easily daunted

and intimidate us This didn t go well for them it never does says Jorge Fe So we had a bit more than a conversation with them He will not be drawn on whether there was violence Dealing with these kinds of people is like a children s game for us we have champion fighters on our team he says After several visits from Jorge Fe and his heavies the squatters got the message They understood they had to negotiate that we were serious and wanted to reclaim the property They asked for money in exchange for leaving And that s what was agreed in this case Property lawyer Santi Ventall sees extortion in or of the cases he handles where landlords have unwanted residents But he believes it will become more common I think this is okupaci n he says And the reason for that is because the courts take so long to act The legal system isn t working so owners are paying squatters to get out immediately It s something I would do too if I had a second home or real estate assets and they were occupied I d pay off the squatters to get them out So this is a very easy way to make money Listen to Linda Pressly and Esperanza Escribano s report for Crossing Continents on BBC Radio at on Thursday August Or catch up later online It s so much easier than robbing a bank according to a man who claims to be a career criminal The man who we will call Javier spoke on condition of anonymity He told us he was a former cocaine dealer and bank robber But now his main illegal activity is extortion In Barcelona alone there are an estimated empty flats or homes After the crash of property prices plummeted and speculation soared With homelessness still a big problem unoccupied real estate is a source of grievance especially as most of it is owned by large firms Javier claims he and his cronies target expensive apartments owned by finance companies and banks I break in on a Friday The following Monday I call the bank and say Hey you guys I m in your flat and I m going to destroy it I can send you pictures if you like And the people from the bank say Whoa we re sending someone to see you And then that person comes and negotiates the price Javier says he can make around or euros each time The ransom depends on the quality of the flat If it s worth one or two million euros then they pay you more He claims to have broken into around properties in the last year It is unlikely banks would admit to the BBC that they were paying off criminals so we tried to check out what Javier told us with other contacts Though we couldn t verify the details no one was surprised by his stories Short presentational grey line Another of Javier s scams is to change the locks of empty apartments then sell the keys for or euros to impoverished people who struggle to pay a market rent a group that has grown in size since the start of the pandemic Most people buying the keys do so knowing that the seller is not the owner of the property says lawyer Santi Ventall They buy the keys knowing the law is soft the legal system is collapsed and they re going to be able to stay at least one or two years But others can be conned into paying rent to crooks who have taken possession of the property That is what happened to Mariana Stirbu who moved into a flat in the La Sagrera district of Barcelona with her partner and two children three years ago The two men who rented us the flat seemed like the owners they were wearing suits and we went to sign the contract We were paying euros a month so everything seemed fine she says That was not the case and Mariana only found out when court officials arrived to evict the family soon after they had begun living there She showed them her paperwork and they gave her days grace When social services said they could not help Mariana turned to a housing pressure group the PAH set up when the property crash of left around a million people unable to pay their mortgages And for the last three years PAH activists have prevented Mariana s family from being evicted In May though the owners of Mariana s flat Coral Homes evidently thought they should try a different tack Enter one of the other companies specialising in eviction One morning someone knocked heavily on the front door says Mariana There were big men outside They said I had the option to leave with the money they could give me Or if not they told me they would be outside my door every day with dogs And they said We re not going to let you in or out The men were offering thousands of euros she says but this wasn t a long term solution to her problem because she and her husband just don t earn enough to pay the market rent for an apartment large enough for their family Coral Homes told the BBC they would not comment on Mariana s case And the eviction company did not respond to the BBC s requests to explain its actions Luc a Mart n Barcelona City Council s housing minister is suspicious of eviction companies What we ve seen are cases of bullying and threats And they ve tried to remove vulnerable families by force taking advantage of the fact that those people don t know the law protects them she says Luc a Mart n cut her political teeth in the PAH the housing pressure group She believes Catalonia and Spain more widely is dealing with the fall out from decades of failing to invest in social housing Though it has now started building new homes its policy in the meantime is to stop the evictions of vulnerable people from homes they are squatting in by negotiating with the landlord or even paying rent so they can stay put Luc a Mart n rejects the charge that Catalonia s squatter friendly policies might encourage extortionists like the young men who occupied Michael Regan s flat in Sitges or the former bank robber who claims he makes thousands of euros from demanding ransoms from property owners It s a fallacy to think the mafias are going to disappear if we make squatting laws harsher she says The criminals are taking advantage of a real problem which is the lack of affordable housing Short presentational grey line In Sitges Michael Regan was satisfied with the way FueraOkupas managed his situation the squatters were out within two weeks Initially they wanted euros to leave but Jorge was able to negotiate the figure down to euros and I said Just pay it I didn t hesitate he says There is a troubling question at the heart of these cases are the eviction companies fuelling extortion demands by offering money to okupas to leave a property before they have actually asked for it Jorge Fe of FueraOkupas says he has never done this But Mariana Stirbu claims the eviction firm that visited her immediately offered her money to leave Michael Regan is not surprised When I started to investigate different companies one of them wanted euros up front and they said half of that would be immediately paid to the squatters and the other half would be the company s fee I was told not to do that he remembers That s why he chose FueraOkupas he says The BBC has heard from home owners across Spain who are in the process of trying to reclaim their properties Often the squatters had moved into a property as bona fide tenants but then stopped paying rent after a month or two Perhaps some were waiting for an eviction company to offer them a payoff And there continue to be rumours about the relationship between eviction companies and criminal squatter gangs They might even be linked says Michael Regan I ve heard very strange stories it is quite murky A new alarm system protects his apartment now The young men who passed their time playing board games at his flat did not damage the property but they did steal all Michael s and his partner s clothes They left just one pair of shoes in the wardrobe a pair of leopard skin lace ups

12,real estate,SINGAPORE SHANGHAI Sept Reuters China Evergrande is teetering between a messy meltdown with far reaching impacts a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing for what was once the country s top selling property developer Founded in Guangzhou in Evergrande has epitomised China s freewheeling era of borrowing and building but with liabilities of nearly two trillion yuan billion its possible collapse looms as one of China s largest for years Debt and land buying curbs and hundreds of new rules have been imposed on Chinese developers over recent years as part of a push to cut financial risks and promote affordable housing Evergrande HK which accelerated efforts to cut its debts in after regulators introduced caps does not have any major offshore bond maturities until early next year but tardy payment of suppliers and interest on loans have brought to a head concerns that have long nagged at investors Now without access to fresh funding Evergrande cannot pay suppliers finish projects or raise income prompting it to hire advisors and warn of default risk This along with a buyout break up or bailout are the scenarios now being evaluated read more And while analysts have played down comparisons to the collapse of U S investment bank Lehman Brothers which caused crises at counterparties and ultimately seized up global markets some investors have similar contagion concerns If as expected Evergrande is defaulting on its debt and goes through a restructuring I don t see why it would be contained Michel Lowy of banking and asset management firm SC Lowy which focuses on distressed and high yield debt said There are other developers that are suffering from the same problem of no access to liquidity and have extended themselves too much Lowy added Other worries include the exposure of banks and the determination of regulators to press on with property market reforms despite hints of damaging consequences read more Reaction has so far concentrated in the bond market and on Evergrande s stock as well as the stocks and bonds of other developers such as among others Guangzhou R F Properties Co HK and Xinyuan Real Estate Co XIN N Evergrande shares are down about in months while its dollar bonds are trading at below par Stress is mounting for the most obvious grey rhino in China namely the real estate sector Natixis economist Alicia Garcia Herrero said FIRE SALE The most immediate concern is of a real estate crash rather than a Lehman style financial crisis An Evergrande fire sale could crush prices causing leveraged developers to blow up and crippling a sector comprising a quarter of China s economy Lehman was very different as it went across the financial system freezing activity said Patrick Perret Green an independent London based analyst Millions of contracts with multiple counterparties everyone was trying to work out their exposure he said With Evergrande it depresses the entire real estate sector Bank exposure is also wide and a leaked document written off as a fabrication by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts showed liabilities extending to more than banks and over non banking institutions But data suggests non performing loans at commercial banks were a manageable last quarter and compared to the United States China has far greater control over its financial system A drive by authorities to cut developers debts is also seen as increasing the likelihood of a property liquidation The government has worked tirelessly to drive de leveraging in the bloated real estate sector so throwing a lifeline to Evergrande now is unlikely said James Shi distressed debt analyst at credit analytics provider Reorg Analysts are increasingly expecting a managed collapse that seeks to protect smaller investors with around a hundred angrily showing up to Evergrande s headquarters on Tuesday while bondholders take a haircut We do not believe the government has an incentive to bail out Evergrande which is a private owned enterprise Nomura analyst Iris Chen said in a note to clients But they will also not actively push Evergrande down and will supervise a more orderly default if any in our view If Evergrande is to recoup anything it must first find buyers for its assets which it has been struggling to do as potential saviours seem content to wait for more distress In a stock exchange announcement on Tuesday Evergrande said it had not been able to complete the disposal of its office building in Hong Kong within the expected timetable The ongoing negative media reports concerning the group have dampened the confidence of potential property purchasers Evergrande added 
13,real estate,This week the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce the unwinding of its monthly bond buying program a measure it started to support the economy during the pandemic However the bigger story for markets is how the central bank will discuss inflation That s because report after report of hotter than anticipated inflation has ramped up expectations that the Fed will fight the trend of higher prices by beginning to raise interest rates next year about six months sooner than the last Federal Reserve forecast Economists expect the central bank to say after its day meeting concludes Wednesday that it will begin winding down its billion in monthly bond purchases by mid November or December and end the program entirely by the middle of next year Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made an effort to emphasize that the end of the program does not signal the start of a new rate hike cycle and he is expected to repeat that message at his post meeting briefing Wednesday But already traders are pricing in more than two interest rate hikes for next year while the majority of Fed officials do not even see one in in their most recent forecast That s because inflation now at a year high has become hotter and seems to be lingering longer than the transitory or temporary description the Fed had included in its recent policy statements My sense is the word transitory has left the station I would be shocked if we heard that word come up again said Rick Rieder chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock He said it will be important to watch how the Fed addresses employment the other half of its dual mandate Rising inflation and wages Inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index rose for September driving the year over year gain to the fastest since January Companies struggling to find workers are also raising wages to keep and attract employees I think it s the hottest job market since World War I Rieder said We had the highest employment cost index print since The wages are accelerating dramatically and I think the Fed is behind the curve I think they need to open the window to raise rates Rieder said he does not expect the Fed or Powell in his post meeting briefing to discuss raising the federal funds rates from the current zero level The federal funds rate which is set by the central bank is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight There s clearly movement toward the Fed recognizing that inflation is stickier than they thought it would be said Rieder I think Powell will lay out data that they anticipate some of these inflation numbers are coming down and I think he s right But Rieder said the Fed needs to show it would be willing to raise interest rates if it had to According to the CME s FedWatch Tool traders see a chance the Fed begins to raise interest rates by a quarter point in June and a chance for a second hike in September with a third also possible Unwinding is the first step The Fed took unprecedented moves to rapidly ease policy when the pandemic hit in early The Fed quickly cut rates to zero and the bond buying program was instituted to rapidly provide liquidity to markets Tapering bond purchases or quantitative easing will be the first unwind of a major program The Fed is widely expected to detail that it will slow down its buying of Treasurys by billion a month and mortgage securities by billion a month A wild card for the Fed has been Covid itself and the outbreak of the delta variant is widely blamed for the abrupt slowdown in growth in the third quarter Gross domestic product grew at just a pace just a quarter of what some economists expected for the period earlier in the year While the Fed is likely to acknowledge slower growth economists already see it picking up again in the current quarter Mark Cabana head of U S short rates strategy at Bank of America said there s a chance that the Fed could say it may speed up or slow down its tapering process as needed If the central bank does talk about increasing the pace as some Fed members had favored a more rapid rollback at the last meeting that could affect the market That just raises the risk that the Fed ends up sounding hawkish said Cabana Interest rates Powell is not likely to talk about raising interest rates but he s not likely to discourage the market s pricing in of rate hikes either The first rate hike is priced in for July It s too soon for the Fed to push back on hikes He s not going to tell the market that it s wrong said Cabana There s upside inflation risk They don t know for sure how inflation is going to evolve Rieder said he doubts Powell would talk about the potential to taper faster My gut is that s not being considered today but if he did say we could taper faster then markets would interpret that as they are considering raising rates sooner and or more aggressively he said But no matter what Powell says about the link between the tapering and bond buying the market s chief interest is inflation and the interest rate moves it could trigger Diane Swonk chief economist at Grant Thornton said she expects the Fed will be forced to raise rates next year Our own forecast has core PCE peaking above by year end and slowing to by mid The unemployment rate is expected to dip below in the first half of Swonk noted Those shifts would prompt more rapid tapering and faster rate hikes than the Federal Reserve laid out in its September forecasts Market participants are now expecting three rate hikes next year we could see more

17,home buying,Seventeen years ago when Adriana Nichols moved from New York City to Los Angeles she had a simple wish list natural light her New York studio apartment was dark a yard and quiet neighbors She managed to check everything off that list and has spent nearly two decades living in the canyons of LA But today as she looks to move again with her husband her requirements have changed It is profoundly a different wish list A place where we have running water where we are not having bags packed in case fires evacuate us said Nichols In the last few years Nichols says the California wildfires and poor air quality make living there unappealing and downright scary But she says nearly everyplace she looks to move to is experiencing some element of climate risk And a new analysis by Redfin a real estate brokerage reveals more Americans are moving into areas that face the highest climate risks than ever before Redfin analyzed data from ClimateCheck a real estate climate risk assessment provider and the US Census which showed that of the top US counties facing climate risks in heat storms drought flood and fire the majority saw an increase in population over the last five years Counties with homes facing the highest heat risk saw populations increase by an average of over the last five years Counties with homes facing high drought risk saw population growth of fire risk counties grew by flood and storm over the last five years Meanwhile places with relatively low climate risks have experienced population declines The counties with the lowest number of homes facing heat risk for example saw a population loss of in the last five years according to Redfin Counties around New York City and Chicago both in states that were already leading the US in population decline only lost more people during the pandemic when homebuyers left metro areas in exodus according to Redfin Counterintuitively people are moving to places with higher climate risk said Daryl Fairweather chief economist at Redfin And it seems like climate although it s something that people care about is at the bottom of the list or it s not the top priority For example migration to Wasatch County Utah just outside Salt Lake City is up almost in the last five years But Wasatch County has the third highest fire risk in the US with of the homes there at risk according to Redfin The area became even more popular in the last year amid the pandemic with people looking for affordability more space and proximity to the outdoors saw some of the worst wildfires we ve ever seen in Utah said Ryan Aycock agent and market manager for Redfin in Salt Lake City I don t necessarily believe that it s going to slow down the people moving into the area It s still extremely affordable It s still a very desirable place to live compared to a lot of places Affordability appears to be a big factor Of the counties with the largest share of homes facing high heat and storm risk more than half had a median sale price below the national average of Redfin found Nothing will deter them Williamson County Texas part of the Austin metro area has the highest heat risk in the US yet it s the county with the biggest growth in population at since according to Redfin People live in San Francisco or New York for the most part because it s where they are able to advance their careers the most but now Austin is starting to rise as a tech hub and Austin has climate risk said Fairweather It s also where people are buying their second homes followed by Florida where homebuyers are taking advantage of lower taxes said Scott Durkin CEO of Douglas Elliman I think people continue to put climate risk in the back of their minds I think there are people that will do anything to be on the ocean and the coast of Florida and nothing nothing will deter them said Durkin That s despite a record breaking Atlantic hurricane season last year And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA is predicting a chance of an above normal hurricane season again this year with Florida often a target Still home sales in Palm Beach and Miami are up and respectively since last year according to Douglas Elliman During the pandemic fueled red hot housing market many buyers waived home inspections to beat out other buyers according to Durkin However in climate temperate areas Durkin advises against that If you ve got something that has the elements of the strong weather or subject to heavy winds and waves breaking and beach erosion you have to really think twice You may want to get the inspection on the way in before you even negotiate just so you know for yourself said Durkin As for Nichols she wants to be out of her Los Angeles home in a matter of months It s no longer a question of Where do we want to live The question has become Where can we live in relationship to what s happening there climate wise said Nichols

unprecedented level of bond purchases as the first step toward normalizing monetary policy Although investor expectations are high that tapering will start in there is still much uncertainty around when the Fed will announce and subsequently reduce bond purchases The same applies to when it will then hike interest rates for the first time since before the pandemic led it to slash rates to zero Here are five of the main issues investors will be watching at the conclusion of the Fed s two day meeting on Wednesday Most Fed officials have voiced support for a reduction in bond purchases beginning this year so long as the labor market continues to improve While it is possible that the Fed will announce a taper of its billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities MBS this week with purchases to be reduced as soon as November recent weakness in economic data has reduced the likelihood of such a move Jobs data for August came in well below expectations while red hot inflation boosted by businesses reopening after COVID related shutdowns is showing signs of moderation read more Investors are focused on any new signals on when a taper may begin and whether the move will be pegged to concrete improvement in data including employment The Fed s early November meeting will take place before it sees the employment data for October which may leave policymakers hesitant to decide before December The pace of a reduction will also be key for how long it will take to end the quantitative easing which is expected to conclude before the Fed raises rates Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who is due to speak after the meeting statement may also indicate that the Fed could speed up slow down or stop any taper if economic conditions deteriorate The Fed has been careful to try to separate any timetable for reducing bond purchases from lifting rates from zero for the first time since March but that may not be as easy as some think If employment continues to improve and inflation stays above target the conditions for tapering may also be viewed as the same for lifting rates The Fed spooked investors in June after policymakers said they were forecasting two interest rate hikes in read more The dot plot where Fed officials place their projections for the federal funds rate this month will update whether these expectations have changed It will also offer the first peek at Fed officials expectations for If rate projections through this date come in more hawkish than expected then intermediate dated note yields which are sensitive to possible rate hikes in this time frame could rise Fed funds futures are priced for the first interest rate increase to occur in March WILL HIGH INFLATION PROVE TRANSITORY The key argument underpinning when rates may be raised is whether the Fed will be able to wait to see the economic improvement it wants before tightening or if spiraling price pressures will force it to act Recent softening in prices will bolster Powell s argument that high inflation will prove transitory The inflation linked swap curve is downward sloping reflecting expectations that annual increases in the Consumer Price Index have peaked But it is not clear when supply chain disruptions that have helped push up overall prices will ease Plus new restrictions from the potential spread of coronavirus variants are a wildcard on whether inflation will continue to accelerate or stay at elevated levels The economic projections released on Wednesday are likely to show a wide range of inflation forecasts from policymakers who may differ on whether inflation risks are to the upside or downside ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS Policymakers economic projections for growth and employment released with the dot plots after the March June September and December meetings will offer insight on whether policymakers are concerned that growth and employment may lag inflation leaving the Fed in a bind over how to normalize policy Some investors are concerned that the U S economy could enter a period of stagflation in which pricing pressures rise even as growth is sluggish A Bank of America report released earlier this month showed that investors have swept into assets that are perceived to perform better in such an environment when typically very few asset classes perform well PROPORTIONAL MBS AND TREASURY REDUCTIONS Since the pandemic started the U S central bank has been buying billion in Treasury securities and billion in mortgage backed bonds per month Speculation that the Fed may reduce purchases of mortgage backed securities before or at a faster pace than Treasuries has faded as Fed officials play down the prospect that MBS buying has contributed to record housing prices across the country Powell said in July that he expects the Fed to wind down the purchases of Treasuries and MBS at the same time read more Still investors will watch for any indications that this policy is being reconsidered

43,mortgage,The Federal Reserve will start to shutter its pandemic era bond buying program later this year leaving the U S central bank with a balance sheet of more than trillion before the purchases end in mid and a likely debate coming about what to do different next time The quick answer may be nothing By roughly doubling the size of its securities holdings since the start of the pandemic in early the Fed helped stabilize financial markets used its ongoing purchases to signal it would battle the economic crisis for as long as necessary and has now planned its wind down with no market tantrum Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaking to reporters on Wednesday after the end of a two day policy meeting said the central bank would start paring its billion in monthly asset purchases soon and end them by the middle of next year read more It served its purpose said Tom Garretson senior portfolio strategist at RBC Wealth Management The bigger issue Garretson and others noted is that beyond the initial impact on financial markets it s not certain the Fed s bond buying or quantitative easing as it s known in monetary policy circles would have been enough to offset last year s deep if short recession without the massive government spending that was authorized by Congress The takeaway Monetary policy run by the Fed and fiscal programs implemented by elected officials will need to pull together in future recessions as well The dominant lesson is that the tools of the Federal Reserve and other central banks are substantially inadequate for dealing with a material weakening of economic activity and fiscal policymakers need to recognize that said David Wilcox former head of the Fed s research division and now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics UNCONVENTIONAL NO LONGER Both the Fed s crisis response and some of the fiscal aid out of Washington are now set to shrink which could act as a drag on an economy still emerging from the pandemic with growth expected to slow in after a healthy rebound this year But those programs did produce some unexpectedly fortunate results notably an increase in household incomes and wealth and a drop in poverty despite the recession read more For the Fed the pandemic cemented its once unconventional purchases of U S Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities as a core part of monetary policy the preferred way to continue helping the economy once the central bank s benchmark overnight interest rate or federal funds rate has been cut to zero Other programs broadened temporarily the type of securities the Fed could buy to include municipal and corporate bonds At a congressional hearing on Thursday Roosevelt Institute economist Mike Konczal said that should be a permanent part of Fed policy Those efforts were more successful than people realize in holding down borrowing costs for local governments and companies Konczal said and are an evolution of unconventional monetary policy that is likely to stay with us Other central banks have already broadened the assets they can purchase beyond securities issued and backed by governments The scale and length of Fed purchases during the pandemic did vex some elected officials while some policymakers felt the program was providing little benefit in recent months Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics That may argue for more flexibility during the next crisis around how and when to end the asset purchases The Fed s pandemic driven QE was tied tightly to the performance of the job market With the labor market healing more slowly than the economy as a whole and inflation now a concern they needed an escape hatch said William English a Yale School of Management professor and former head of the Fed s monetary affairs division ANNOUNCEMENT EFFECTS QE entered the lexicon of U S monetary policy in as part of then Fed Chair Ben Bernanke s response to the financial crisis and recession The Fed unlike the European Central Bank has not wanted to resort to using negative interest rates to stimulate the economy so once the zero lower bound of the federal funds rate is reached it uses bond purchases to further lower the cost of credit That encourages purchases of homes autos and other items that involve longer term loans and can raise asset prices and contribute to wealth effect spending too Just how effective it is and what risks it may pose remains a subject of debate Fed staff and policymakers on their own have published nearly papers since arguing about the advantages limits and risks of QE The general conclusion is that it helps particularly early in a crisis when the mere announcement of central bank support can lift confidence and over time help anchor interest rates One indicator of that impact what s known as the shadow federal funds rate is currently estimated at in effect where the Fed s target rate would need to be to produce the current levels of bond yields Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics One of the reasons it may be hard for the Fed to deviate much from the way it did QE during the pandemic is precisely because it is the early promise of open ended support that seems to be a chief benefit The details may differ next time Policymakers disagree for example over the mix of monthly asset purchases split between billion of Treasury securities and billion of mortgage backed assets at a time when home prices are skyrocketing But if the pandemic proved anything it s that scale matters and that it s better to plan for the worst and be surprised on the upside The pandemic looked like a long lasting Great Depression level event in March when the U S central bank slashed the federal funds rate to near zero and made an open ended commitment to purchase assets that raised its holdings of securities from trillion to around trillion by late May of that year We can all complain about QE being imprecise and not being quite sure how it works and not being sure how much it works said Cornerstone Macro economist Roberto Perli But what is the alternative Perli said Come the next recession you most likely will have to do it again in a decent size and with the same general composition

50,mortgage,Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell s highly anticipated speech to the Jackson Hole economic conference on Friday will likely offer few new hints about when the U S central bank may start reducing its massive asset purchases analysts said But Powell could tackle the sensitive task of explaining why tapering the billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities doesn t mean an imminent interest rate hike advancing an effort by Fed policymakers to keep traders from pushing up borrowing costs more than the central bank may feel is warranted or healthy for an economy with millions still unemployed He will do his best to say these are independent decisions and one does not necessarily speed up the other said Steve Kelly a research associate at the Yale School of Management That s the biggest challenge this communication around tapering and rate increases Fed officials agree The minutes of their July policy meeting show that many thought it would be important to emphasize there is no mechanical link between a bond buying taper and rate hikes Rejecting that link won t be simple Many Fed officials also felt it would be better to end the bond buying program before raising rates And they continue to debate whether to dial down the purchases quickly or stretch them out for perhaps as many as eight months Additionally some policymakers argue the bond purchases aren t helping much anyway since they are aimed at bolstering demand but can t address the bottlenecks businesses face as they struggle to meet that demand as the economy rapidly reopens With so much unsettled the odds were always long that Powell would use his remarks to the Kansas City Fed s central banking conference which normally takes place in Jackson Hole Wyoming but is being held virtually for the second straight year to satisfy investors craving for taper timeline details That s especially so now as the surging Delta variant of the coronavirus shows signs of slowing the U S economic recovery particularly in regions of the country hardest hit by infections read more The data raises new questions about what appeared to be an emerging internal consensus at the Fed s meeting last month for beginning to withdraw its extraordinary support for the economy later this year Even Dallas Fed Kaplan among the biggest supporters at the central bank of an early taper said last week he is starting to see signs of Delta s impact and will keep an open mind in the run up to the Fed s policy meeting next month read more It s hard to imagine the Fed committing to a specific tapering timeline in light of the ongoing public health crisis Aneta Markowska a Jefferies economist said of Powell s upcoming speech Powell who is due to speak via webcast at a m EDT GMT on Friday may acknowledge the economy s progress toward full employment Markowska and other economists said Although Powell will want to keep the door open to starting the taper in November he will be very cautious about locking in such a timeline Goldman Sachs economists said in a note this week COMPLICATED MESSAGING Economists polled by Reuters expect the U S economy to add another jobs this month on top of the nearly million gained in June and July And inflation a fresh read of which be released shortly before Powell s speech has been running above the Fed s goal for months though most U S central bank policymakers expect it to moderate later this year The data suggests to many Fed policymakers that the economy is near to making substantial further progress toward full employment and inflation the bar they have set before they agree to pare the monthly asset purchases But to preserve low long run interest rates for an economy that is still recovering from the downdraft triggered by the pandemic Powell will also want to underscore that the hurdle for tapering is far shy of meeting the three part trigger for rate hikes The bar for raising borrowing costs includes actually attaining full employment and seeing inflation on track to be moderately above for some time It s complicated messaging right now said Tim Duy chief U S economist at SGH Macro Advisors The reality is the tapering is not separate from the rate hike once you start the tapering you kind of start a clock on the rate hike And yet it is that kind of jump the gun reaction that Powell will want to head off In when then Fed Chair Ben Bernanke tried to smoothly foreshadow a coming reduction in bond purchases traders responded by driving up long term rates so sharply that the Fed ultimately had to delay dialing down its purchases Markets typically judge Fed communications most harshly at such policy turns If they do so again it could prove awkward timing for Powell as U S President Joe Biden weighs whether to nominate him for another four years as Fed chief Deteriorating grades from Wall Street notwithstanding it s clear the Powell led Fed is on a path to taper even if his speech this week is expected to offer little news on exactly when Even the dovish San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said last week that she s confident the economy will meet the bar the central bank has set for beginning to reduce its support by the end of this year The key message there is that it s time really to think about dialing back that level of support we are giving to the economy because the economy is really standing on its own two feet Daly said in a virtual interview with Barron s Roundtable adding however that she would be open minded about the Delta variant s impact and could see a delay into next year
