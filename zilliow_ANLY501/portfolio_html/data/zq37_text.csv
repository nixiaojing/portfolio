"A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[citation needed] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.[citation needed] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. "

"Hyacinthus is a small genus of bulbous, spring-blooming flower. They are fragrant flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae and are commonly called hyacinths. The genus is native to the area of the eastern Mediterranean from the north of Bulgaria through to the northern part of Israel. Several species of Brodiaea, Scilla, and other plants that were formerly classified in the lily family and have flower clusters borne along the stalk also have common names with the word ""hyacinth"" in them. Hyacinths should also not be confused with the genus Muscari, which are commonly known as grape hyacinths"

"Myosotis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. The name comes from the Ancient Greek μυοσωτίς ""mouse's ear"", which the foliage is thought to resemble.[3] In the northern hemisphere they are colloquially denominated forget-me-nots[4] or scorpion grasses. The colloquial name ""forget-me-not"" was calqued from the German Vergissmeinnicht and first used in English in AD 1398 through King Henry IV of England.[5] Similar names and variations are found in many languages. Myosotis alpestris is the official flower of Alaska[6] and Dalsland, Sweden. Plants of the genus are commonly confused with Chatham Islands' forget-me-nots which belong to the related genus Myosotidium."
