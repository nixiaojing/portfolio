                                <span>Reddit is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website.
                                </span>
                                <p>Registered users (commonly referred to as "Redditors") submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called "communities" or "subreddits". Submissions with more upvotes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough upvotes, ultimately on the site's front page. Reddit administrators moderate the communities.

                        <h3><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h3>
                        <h4>Reddit is a social media website in which users can post text, links, and other forms of media about a variety of topics 
                            into different communities called "subreddits." With over 50 million unique visitors daily and 100 thousand active subreddits, 
                            Reddit is a popular medium through which many people engage with news, politics, and a myriad of other topics. 
                            The realm of sports is no exception, as subreddits surrounding sports related topics have over 30 million subscribers 
                            in aggregate. For many fans, Reddit is the primary platform through which they keep up with their favorite sport.
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Professional sports leagues and organizations are constantly trying to increase their fan engagement. 
                            The MLB's institution of numerous rule changes over recent years is a prime example of a sports organization 
                            devoting a significant amount of resources in an attempt to increase viewership. Given that many fans utilize 
                            Reddit to follow sports, it would be worthwhile for leagues to investigate what kinds of sports posts seem to be captivating 
                            their viewers attention. By understanding the Reddit landscape and why certain types of posts are popular, 
                            these sports organizations could potentially better cater to their fans' interests. For the first portion of our project, 
                            we attempted to explore this area by analyzing what factors impact post engagement and popularity within sports related 
                            subreddits.
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h4>In addition to keeping up with a sport as a whole, many people use Reddit to follow and discuss their favorite team 
                            specifically. Popular sports teams often have subreddits with thousands of subscribers who interact with one another 
                            and discuss topics related to their team. The majority of these subreddits also host live game threads in which fans 
                            can post comments about a game in real time. Games with large viewership often have game threads with hundreds of 
                            upvotes and thousands of comments. The Astros/Phillies World Series game 6 thread, for example, garnered 270 upvotes 
                            and 7,746 comments.
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Like the leagues as a whole, individual teams are also constantly trying to increase their fan engagement. 
                            Analyzing comments of game threads would be a valuable way for these organizations to understand fans' live 
                            thoughts and reactions to their team's gameplay. This additional understanding would likewise enable teams 
                            to better cater to fans' interests and take measures to improve their organization accordingly. After 
                            providing analysis on the topic of sports as a whole as mentioned above, we dove into a more specific team-based 
                            analysis to explore this topic. To do so, we utilized comments from Yankees game threads in the 2021 season as a 
                            case study. We found this a valuable addition to our analysis as we were able to explore sports topics at both a 
                            broad level and through a specific example.

                                <span>Reddit is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website.
                                </span>
                                <p>Registered users (commonly referred to as "Redditors") submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called "communities" or "subreddits". Submissions with more upvotes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough upvotes, ultimately on the site's front page. Reddit administrators moderate the communities.

                        <h3><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h3>
                        <h4>Reddit is a social media website in which users can post text, links, and other forms of media about a variety of topics 
                            into different communities called "subreddits." With over 50 million unique visitors daily and 100 thousand active subreddits, 
                            Reddit is a popular medium through which many people engage with news, politics, and a myriad of other topics. 
                            The realm of sports is no exception, as subreddits surrounding sports related topics have over 30 million subscribers 
                            in aggregate. For many fans, Reddit is the primary platform through which they keep up with their favorite sport.
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Professional sports leagues and organizations are constantly trying to increase their fan engagement. 
                            The MLB's institution of numerous rule changes over recent years is a prime example of a sports organization 
                            devoting a significant amount of resources in an attempt to increase viewership. Given that many fans utilize 
                            Reddit to follow sports, it would be worthwhile for leagues to investigate what kinds of sports posts seem to be captivating 
                            their viewers attention. By understanding the Reddit landscape and why certain types of posts are popular, 
                            these sports organizations could potentially better cater to their fans' interests. For the first portion of our project, 
                            we attempted to explore this area by analyzing what factors impact post engagement and popularity within sports related 
                            subreddits.
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h4>In addition to keeping up with a sport as a whole, many people use Reddit to follow and discuss their favorite team 
                            specifically. Popular sports teams often have subreddits with thousands of subscribers who interact with one another 
                            and discuss topics related to their team. The majority of these subreddits also host live game threads in which fans 
                            can post comments about a game in real time. Games with large viewership often have game threads with hundreds of 
                            upvotes and thousands of comments. The Astros/Phillies World Series game 6 thread, for example, garnered 270 upvotes 
                            and 7,746 comments.
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Like the leagues as a whole, individual teams are also constantly trying to increase their fan engagement. 
                            Analyzing comments of game threads would be a valuable way for these organizations to understand fans' live 
                            thoughts and reactions to their team's gameplay. This additional understanding would likewise enable teams 
                            to better cater to fans' interests and take measures to improve their organization accordingly. After 
                            providing analysis on the topic of sports as a whole as mentioned above, we dove into a more specific team-based 
                            analysis to explore this topic. To do so, we utilized comments from Yankees game threads in the 2021 season as a 
                            case study. We found this a valuable addition to our analysis as we were able to explore sports topics at both a 
                            broad level and through a specific example.

                    <h3><u><b>Executive Summary</b></u></h3>
                    <h4>We explored a variety of questions surrounding activity within sports subreddits and came 
                    away with a few key findings. We examined first which factors influence post popularity 
                    utilizing the NBA subreddit, and found that the number of crossposts a post received and 
                    its gilded status were moderately associated with its score. We also looked at the time 
                    of posting within both the NBA and NFL subreddits, and found that the amount of submissions 
                    posted and the average upvotes differed fairly significantly depending on the time of day 
                    and time of the week. Time of the year for post submission also had significant variations. 
                    Unsurprisingly, post frequency peaked in the beginning of the season (August) and end of 
                    the season (June) for the NFL, while post frequency shot up significantly during January 
                    and peaked around the playoffs (June) for the NBA. We also found that NFL teams with better 
                    performing teams and larger fanbases tended to have a larger subscriber count with their 
                    respective subreddit. While each of these findings proved interesting on their own, the 
                    main overall takeaway seems to be that there is a lot of valuable information to be found 
                    about general trends and fans’ interests for sports subreddits. Sports teams and 
                    organizations could gain significant value by diving into these questions to better 
                    understand what factors lead to increased engagement.</h4>

                    <h4></h4>
                    <h4>Knowing we wanted to explore what makes for a popular post in sports subreddits, 
                        we selected two sample subreddits to examine features contained within the pushshift 
                        reddit dataset that we thought might have an influence on popularity. We focused simply 
                        on posts within the NBA subreddit to begin with and selected “score” as our measure of 
                        popularity. Score measures the total amount of upvotes minus downvotes a post received, 
                        which is a good indicator of whether a significant amount of people found value in a 
                        given post. We first examined the distribution of scores for all posts and found they 
                        were heavily skewed to the left. We then created another subset of data containing only 
                        posts with scores greater than 500. This subset of data was not as left skewed, but only 
                        slightly.

                    <h4>For each question we isolated the necessary dataset, created dummy variables and conducted 
                        data transformations where needed, measured the Pearson correlation with “score,” and 
                        created visualizations to demonstrate the findings. For a full review of the results 
                        and work done, you can view our notebook <a href="https://github.com/gu-anly502/fall-2022-reddit-big-data-project-project-group-22/blob/master/code/eda/exported_databricks_nbs/project_eda.ipynb" target="blank">here</a>. 
                        Some of our more interesting results included that aggregate post score for the author 
                        of a given post was weakly correlated with score for that particular current post. 
                        In other words, past success was a slight predictor of current success for the author 
                        of a post. Regarding our question about video links, while we hypothesized that posts 
                        with videos would receive more impressions and thus higher scores, the Pearson 
                        correlation did not confirm this hypothesis. Finally, we saw that gilded status was 
                        heavily correlated with post performance. A gilded status can be obtained by paying 
                        for the “gilded” badge which is then awarded to a post. It is our hypothesis that 
                        most posts with this status received it after becoming very popular, though we will 
                        need to investigate further to confirm. We also conducted some basic analysis based 
                        on the time in which a post was submitted. We found that posts submitted on the weekend 
                        received a slightly lower average score than those submitted on the weekday, and posts 
                        during the fall received the highest average score on a seasonal basis.

                    <h4>After completing this analysis, we decided to switch sports and instead examine 
                        the NFL.The question we aimed to explore was if teams that have performed 
                        historically well generally had larger corresponding subreddits. To measure this, 
                        we curated a list of NFL subreddits, grouped by submission count, and then generated 
                        a bar graph of all the teams in ascending order. While in general more historically 
                        successful teams seemed to have higher subscribers, there were some notable 
                        exceptions. The Cowboys low number of subreddit subscribers despite them having 
                        the largest fanbase out of any NFL team, as well as the lions having a high amount 
                        of subscribers despite their absolutely horrendous performance over the past 20 
                        years stood out as two notable exceptions. One possible explanation for this is 
                        that some NFL fan bases are loyal to their team despite poor performance. 
                        A more likely explanation, however, is that some of these teams’ subreddits 
                        were simply created at an earlier date, and hence were able to accrue a larger 
                        amount of subscribers over time.

                    <h4>In our previous NBA analysis, we found that submission posting time may be related 
                        to the popularity of a post. This made us curious as to whether there are any 
                        differences about the distribution in times in which submissions were posted 
                        between sports. We compared the timing of posts between two subreddits, “NBA” 
                        and “NFL” to explore this question. The variable we used in this analysis was 
                        “created_utc,” which we converted from unix time to a Pyspark dataframe timestamp. 
                        We then extracted the time of day, day of the week, and month for further analysis. 
                        Figure 1 shows the comparison between NBA and NFL subreddits over the distribution 
                        of number of submissions across the time of the day. The distribution seems fairly 
                        similar here, however it is possible that NBA fans are active on reddit more in 
                        the night (when converting to Est time). For the day of the week, unsurprisingly, 
                        we see that there is more activity on Sunday and Monday for the NFL subreddit due 
                        to games being played on those days (Figure 9). This phenomenon would be even 
                        more exacerbated if the posts were isolated to the NFL season (Figure 10).
                        As the NBA season is much more spread throughout the year than that of the NFL, 
                        the differences between the distribution of the number of submissions of NFL 
                        and NBA are not surprising. The NFL's posts reach a significant peak as the 
                        playoffs commence and the Super Bowl approaches. A similar phenomenon occurs 
                        in the NBA as the championships approach in June, but it is less pronounced 
                        and less skewed.

                            <h4>There were several key takeaways from our NLP analysis on the Yankees’ subreddit game 
                              threads for the 2021 season. First, we found that Yankees fans' comments within these 
                              game threads were often short in length with a high amount of emotionally charged words 
                              (particularly curse words). While not surprising, this finding reveals insight into how 
                              fans watch games and engage with their favorite team. Furthermore, we found there to be 
                              moderate difference in fan sentiment depending on whether the Yankees won or lost. While 
                              not as large as we originally thought it would be, this difference nonetheless demonstrates 
                              that sentiment analysis of reddit threads can more or less encapsulate the general feelings 
                              of the Yankees’ fanbase. We also found that Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez were two players 
                              mentioned a significant amount of times within comments of these threads during the Yankees’ 
                              2021 season. However, sentiment analysis revealed that while both players were frequently 
                              mentioned, comments about Sanchez were more likely to be negative than comments about Judge.
                              Perhaps the Yankees and other franchises could analyze the sentiment of reddit comments 
                              mentioning their players as an additional metric to evaluate the impact these players 
                              are having on the fan experience.</h4>

                              <h4>In our initial exploratory data analysis, our broad goal for the project was to analyze 
                                general Reddit trends. We picked sports as the subreddit category through which to analyze 
                                these trends and created several business questions specifically related to sports topics. 
                                However, as we began the natural language processing portion of the project, we decided it 
                                would be more valuable to produce analysis on a specific subset of sports data with a 
                                particular focus rather than attempting to address several broad questions. To pick a 
                                specific subset of data, we gathered game threads from the Yankees subreddit for games 
                                during the 2021 season. An example of a Yankees game thread can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/" target="blank">here</a>. 
                                We then merged each of these game threads with external data about each particular game from 
                                <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="blank">baseball-reference.com</a>. Our resulting merged 
                                dataset contained 154 game threads from the Yankees 2021 season with external data on the 
                                outcome of each game. Whe then merged this dataset with the comments for each game thread, 
                                resulting in a final dataset containing roughly 600,000 rows (~4,000 comments per game thread).
                                The code used to produce this dataset can be viewed within our <a href="https://github.com/gu-anly502/fall-2022-reddit-big-data-project-project-group-22/blob/master/code/nlp/Data_Gathering.ipynb" target="blank">Data Gathering notebook</a>. 
                                We then formulated specific business questions pertaining to this data, including:</h4>

                                <h4>For an initial overview of the data, we produced tables displaying the outcomes of these 
                                  Yankees games, the total number of comments in each game thread by outcome, and the 
                                  average number of comments of each game thread by outcome. It is important to note that 
                                  in the outcome column, W-wo signifies a win with a walk-off, while L-wo signifies a loss 
                                  with a walk-off. Interestingly, games with walk-offs had a higher average comment count 
                                  than games without walk-offs, even in the case of a loss (Table 1). Perhaps this is due 
                                  to the fact that the exciting nature of walk-offs leads to more overall comments. We also 
                                  produced a graph displaying which Yankees games throughout the season had the highest 
                                  number of comments in their corresponding game thread (Figure 13).

                                 game threads. This processing included analysis on comment length, most mentioned words, 
                                 and the most "important" words within each comment. The code can be found in our

                                 To begin processing the data, we first removed deleted comments from our dataset. 
                                 We then found the word count for each comment by splitting the body of the 
                                 comment into a string array using the space character to conduct the split. As displayed 
                                 in figure 17, The distribution of comment length is right skewed, and the vast majority of 
                                 comments are less than the average length of a sentence (15-20 words). This is to be 
                                 expected, since comments during a game thread would likely be quick snippets of fans’ 
                                 live reactions to the gameplay.</h4>

                                removed non-text content (e.g. punctuation and emojis), and removed stop-words. 
                                We then generated word clouds to provide a visualization of the most mentioned 
                                words within our dataset (Figure 12). We can see there are a significant amount 
                                of emotional words such as “lol,” “lmao,” and a large amount of curse words. 
                                Notably, there are also several players’ names visible within the word cloud, 
                                such as “Sanchez'' and “Judge.” We also generated a separate word cloud 
                                specifically for the Yankees’ most popular game thread, the Yankees/White Sox 
                                game played on August 6th (Figure 18). In this word cloud, we similarly see a 
                                significant amount of emotional words as well as players’ names. One player 
                                name that is more noticeable within this word cloud is “Heaney,” potentially 
                                signifying that he played a major role in this game, leading to more mentions. 
                                These results answered our first business question, which was that emotional 
                                words and player names are common words used within Yankees game threads. 
                                We also answered our second business question by determining that Gary Sanchez 
                                and Aaaron Judge were two of the most discussed players on the team.</h4>

                              <h4>Given the fact that there was some variation in words mentioned between 
                                the word cloud of all of of the games vs. the word cloud of only the 
                                Yankees/White Sox game, we decided to perform TF-IDF analysis by game 
                                thread to explore which words were most important for each specific game. 
                                We observed several common words among each game in terms of importance, 
                                including “game,” “like,” and “get,” which unfortunately did not reveal 
                                any interesting information. However, we did observe some variation in 
                                the TF-IDF scores of player’s names depending on the game. This is to be 
                                expected, as certain players would be talked about more or less depending 
                                on how they played. Perhaps baseball franchises could utilize TF-IDF scores 
                                for players’ names to analyze the impact they have on the fan experience for 
                                each game. Given the fact that Gary Sanchez and Aaron Judge were two players 
                                that appeared a significant amount in having high TF-IDF scores and overall 
                                mentions, we decided to create two dummy variables to determine whether a 
                                given comment mentioned each of these players - “has_aaron_judge” and 
                                “has_gary_sanchez” (Table 4, 5). Aaraon Judge was mentioned in 14,488 comments, 
                                while Sanchez was mentioned in 1,046 comments. Code for this portion of the

                               <h4>We then conducted sentiment analysis on the comments within our dataset. 
                                We began by utilizing a pretrained sentiment analysis pipeline, courtesy of 
                                John Snow Labs and SparkNLP, which was designed to predict sentiment of tweets. 
                                Our curated output were two variables indicating the probability that a 
                                given reddit comment was positive or negative. We then used this information 
                                to try to determine if games won by the Yankees were generally correlated with 
                                positive comments and if games lost were correlated with negative comments. 
                                Game threads in which the Yankees won (without a walk-off) had a higher 
                                probability of receiving a positive comment (41%) and a lower probability 
                                of receiving a negative comment (58%), while games in which the Yankees 
                                lost had a lower probability of receiving a positive comment (34%) and a 
                                higher probability of receiving a negative comment (65%) (Figure 19). 
                                Despite the difference, the correlation between the sentiment of a comment 
                                and the outcome result was fairly weak (r = .075). Nonetheless, the 
                                difference in sentiment answered our business question that game outcome 
                                does seem to affect comment sentiment. Next we looked at two players, 
                                Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez, and tried to see if comments mentioning 
                                them had a different distribution of sentiment than comments not mentioning 
                                these players. We found that comments which mentioned Gary Sanchez had a 
                                lower probability of being positive and a higher probability of being negative (Table 3). 
                                Conversely, we found that comments mentioning Aaron Judge were more likely 
                                to be positive and less likely to be negative. From these results, we can 
                                assume that Gary Sanchez was not well liked among Yankees fans during the 
                                2021 season, while Aaron Judge was viewed in a positive light. This makes 
                                sense considering Gary Sanchez performed poorly during the 2021 season (.205 BA), 
                                while Aaaron Judge played exceptionally well (.311 BA). This thus provides 
                                insight into our last business question, which is that there was a sentiment 
                                difference among comments mentioning different players. The code can be found

                    <h4>There were a few key findings we came across during the process of conducting machine learning analysis on comments 
                        within Yankees game threads. Notably, during the preliminary steps of building our models, we discovered that the 
                        championship leverage index (cLI) of a game had moderate correlations with both the score and the number of comments 
                        of the game thread. This demonstrates that fans are more engaged when the outcome of a game matters, and also that 
                        cLI seems to be a useful statistic given these correlations. We also found that the amount of runs the Yankees scored in a game likewise had 
                        slight/moderate correlations with the score and number of comments for that game thread. This indicates that fans are 
                        more engaged and active within game threads during games in which Yankees score more runs. Given the fact that scoring in baseball has reached historic 
                        lows, the MLB would be wise to continue to explore rule changes that would increase the amount of runs scored in order 
                        to keep their viewers engaged.

                    <h4>While we discovered some interesting findings surrounding our feature variables, unfortunately we did not have 
                        much success with respect to our model creation. Predicting the sentiment of comments within Yankees game 
                        threads proved difficult, as our best model achieved an accuracy of only 51%. Despite the low score, the fact 
                        that our model received an accuracy higher than one would receive by randomly guessing suggests there is some 
                        predictive value to the variables within our dataset. However, our model would likely need significantly more 
                        data in order to produce better results. Retrieving play by play data for each game and mapping each outcome to 
                        the timestamp of every comment could be a potential method to improve the data for our model. Predicting comments' 
                        scores proved even more difficult, as both of our models predicting the numerical score as well as categories of scores 
                        (negative score, neutral score, and positive scores) produced poor results. Ultimately, it seems that there is a 
                        significant amount of random variability as well as subjectivity that pushes a reddit user to "upvote" a comment, 
                        making it difficult to account for in a model.

                    <h4>Our original goal for this project was to analyze general reddit trends utilizing sports subreddits as our common theme.
                        After pivoting from this goal in our NLP analysis, we created a dataset containing 600 thousand comments from 154 Yankees
                        game threads with post data about each game thread and external data about each game. One of our original business 
                        questions was whether we could build a machine learning model to accurately predict the score of a submission. 
                        Given our new dataset, we decided to slightly alter this question by asking if we could instead predict the score 
                        of a comment given information about the comment, game thread, and Yankees game. For our second business question, 
                        we wanted to see if we could build a model that would accurately predict the sentiment of a comment utilizing these 
                        same variables.
                    </h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        To prepare our data for modeling, we created three new variables and transformed two existing variables within our 
                            dataset. We then filtered our dataset down to contain our two target variables and 13 predictor variables we 
                            determined could be potentially useful to our models. The code for this can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/gu-anly502/fall-2022-reddit-big-data-project-project-group-22/blob/master/code/ml/exported_databricks_nbs/Cleaning%26Prepping_Data_ML.ipynb" target="blank">Cleaning&Prepping_Data_ML 
                            notebook.</a>. We then generated a correlation plot to see which of our numerical variables were correlated with one another, 
                            which produced some interesting findings. Notably, both the number of comments and the score a game thread received 
                            had a moderate correlation with the game's championship leverage index (cLI), a statistic that measures the importance 
                            of a game to a team's chances of winning the World Series. The score and number of comments for a game thread also had 
                            moderate correlations with the amount of runs the Yankees scored for that game (variable R). Unfortunately, regarding 
                            our target variable score_cm, only the length of the comment appeared to have a correlation with a comment's score.

                    <h4>In order to predict the score of a comment within a Yankees game thread given our dataset, we attempted to create two 
                        XGBoost models, one regressor and one classifier (full summary and walkthrough can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gu-anly502/fall-2022-reddit-big-data-project-project-group-22/blob/master/code/ml/exported_databricks_nbs/ML_Modeling.ipynb" target="blank">ML_Modeling notebook</a>). 
                        To create the regression model, we constructed a pipeline that performed indexing of categorical variables, 
                        "assembled" features into a vector format supported by Pyspark, and cross validated training and hyperparameter search 
                        for the XGBoostRegressor model. For hyperparameter tuning, we chose to only tune the max depth of trees grown and 
                        the number of estimators (total trees grown). In practice, these parameters (along with `max_leaves`) typically have 
                        the greatest impact on performance with gradient boosted tree models. We evaluated our model on the test data and 
                        received an RMSE of 3.314, which was a very poor result. We reasoned that this must be due to the amount of noise 
                        within the dataset, as the score of a comment is far from deterministic. One can easily imagine a scenario in which 
                        two nearly identical comments posted by different users at the same time in the same thread receive vastly different 
                        scores simply due to exposure or the momentum of positive/negative votes. To combat this, we decided to bin the score_cm
                        variable into three categories: negative (a score less than -2), neutral (a score between [-2, 2]), and positive 
                        (a score greater than 2). By utilizing these bins, we thought our model could more effectively predict the general 
                        direction of a comment rather than its exact score. We followed a similar pipelining procedure, but instead trained 
                        an XGBoostClassifier model. This model received an f1 score of 0.481 on the testing set, which was likewise a poor 
                        result. Upon further reflection and analysis, it is not entirely surprising that we cannot predict a comment's score 
                        from our dataset. While we may be able to find differences in distributions of scores dependent on these features, 
                        there is simply far too much noise and random variability to create a highly accurate classifier.

                        forest and support vector machine (SVM) (full summary and walkthrough can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gu-anly502/fall-2022-reddit-big-data-project-project-group-22/blob/master/code/ml/exported_databricks_nbs/ML_Sentiment.ipynb" target="blank">ML_Sentiment notebook</a>). 
                        Before training each model, we found that our dataset contains imbalanced sentiment results, which would affect the 
                        random forest model's performance if not addressed. To handle this imbalance, we calculated the weighted score of each 
                        sentiment class and added its value to the dataset. To create the random forest model, we built a pipeline that indexed 
                        and vectorized categorical variables, assembled vectorized variables and numerical variables into Pyspark features, and 
                        conducted a hyperparameter search for the random forest model. We then evaluated our model and received a prediction 
                        accuracy of 53% and an f1 score of 53%. To build the SVM model, we used a one-vs-rest method to train our dataset due to
                        the fact that our sentiment result is not binary. We then constructed a pipeline similar to the one used for our random 
                        forest model and achieved an accuracy of 36% and an f1 score of 41%.

                        The matrices indicate that the random forest model predicted far more negative results and few neutral results, 
                        while the SVM predicted a fairly even distribution for each category. While the random forest model's accuracy outperformed 
                        the SVM model, both ultimately produced poor results. That said, the random forest model's 51% accuracy is enough 
                        to indicate the variables within our dataset do have some predictive capability with regard to a comment's sentiment. 
                        Perhaps we could achieve a better result by utilizing other variables, adding more valuable external data, or 
                        utilizing alternate machine learning models. However, it is worth noting that there are an endless amount of factors 
                        that could lead to a person leaving a positive or negative comment that would be nearly impossible to account for. 
                        Moreover, the model utilized to classify the sentiment of the comment is itself flawed. So even given perfect data, 
                        there would always be some amount of error that exists built into our model.

                    <h4>There were some valuable findings from analyzing sports subreddit data at both a broad and team-specific level. 
                    For our exploratory data analysis, we found that post popularity within sports subreddits was often associated with specific
                     factors about a given post, such as the number of crossposts received and its gilded status. We discovered differences in times 
                     of the day, week, and year in which fans were most engaged with their sport via the amount of submissions and average 
                     upvotes received at various time intervals. We observed that more popular teams with large fan bases tended to have 
                     larger subreddits, although this did not always hold 100% true.

                    our natural language processing and machine learning portions of the project. Through using natural language processing, 
                    we discovered Yankees fans often left short, emotionally charged comments within game threads, demonstrating their 
                    knee-jerk live reactions and passion for the team. Fans also predictably tended to leave comments with positive 
                    sentiment more often in games in which the Yankees won. Regarding the Yankees team itself, Aaron Judge and Gary 
                    Sanchez were two players mentioned most frequently. However, sentiment analysis revealed fans were happy with Judge 
                    and largely negative on Sanchez during the season. Perhaps the Yankees and other franchises could utilize sentiment 
                    analysis via Reddit data on their players to understand the impact each team member is having on the fan experience.

                    <h4>Our most valuable takeaways from our machine learning analysis came from the preliminary steps of building 
                    the model. Through examining the variables in our dataset, we found that games with a higher championship leverage 
                    index and runs scored tended to have more active corresponding game threads. In other words, games that have an 
                    impact on the season's outcome and are generally higher scoring capture fans' attention. Our models performed 
                    poorly in guessing both the score and sentiment of a comment, demonstrating that the amount of random variability 
                    and subjectivity associated with posting and upvoting comments is difficult to account for. However, there is 
                    room for our sentiment model to potentially improve if given a larger amount of data about the play by play 
                    results of the game.

                        peak into what could potentially be learned through this process. Given the fact that we only used Yankees data, the 
                        most straightforward next step to build upon this project is to collect subreddit game thread data from multiple 
                        different teams across several other sports as well. Additionally, better external data could be attained via official 
                        API's to build stronger natural language processing methods as well as improved machine learning models. Overall, 
                        this project nonetheless served as a valuable look into what could be explored utilizing Reddit sports data.

                    <h4>In our ML analysis session (links), we compared two models, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), for predicting sentiment of a comment. 
                        After the deliverables, we added one more transformation, normalization of numeric features, to our data for RF model to see if we could achieve better results. 
                        Unfortunately, the accuracy and test error ended up actually being slightly worse than our previous model(Table 11 and Figure 24). 
                        It seems that additional data would be needed to improve our results, rather than simply changing the inputs or methods of our current model.
